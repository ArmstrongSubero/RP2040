# Program Description: This program demonstrates a Model Predictive Control (MPC) implementation in MicroPython
#                      for controlling both motor speed and temperature simultaneously while respecting constraints.
#                      The MPC controller adjusts the motor power to maintain the desired speed and keep the temperature
#                      within safe limits.
