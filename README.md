# RP2040

Projects in MicroPython and on the Rasbperry Pi Pico (RP2040).
If P stands for Pure Python projects, to complete these you don't need anything except a few LEDs and for many of them
you only need the Pico alone or an RP2040 with a serial connection. 

S are System-level projects. These projects might involve low-level programming, interacting directly with hardware, 
or integrating with operating systems.
